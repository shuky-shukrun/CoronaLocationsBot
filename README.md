# Corona Locations Bot
#### Telegram Bot that tells you if you need to get isolated based on your Google Locations History and the Coronavirus exposed map that was published by the Ministry of Health.
 Link to the bot: https://t.me/CoronaIsraelBot
 
 This Telegram bot gets your google locations history file (json file), compare it against the official data that published by the health ministry of Israel, and tell you if, where, and when have you been in the same place with Corona virus sick person.

 The data can be found here: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=20ded58639ff4d47a2e2e36af464c36e&locale=he

 #### Hamagen app.
 This bot was created 2 days before the Ministry of Health published Hamagen app.
 In the first 2 weeks, Hamagen app could check your locations history only from the time you download the app. This bot could do that for the last 2 weeks, no matter when did you use it.
 Recent update to Hamagen app added the same feature, so this bot is no longer necessary.
 Thanks to all hundreds of users, it's been great to work on a meaningful project :)
